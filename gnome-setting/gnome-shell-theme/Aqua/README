Aqua is a subtle light theme for Gnome Shell (Too much light?). The theme is compatible with the latest Gnome Shell 3.2.

---

Ubuntu users can install Aqua from our themes PPA using the following commands,

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:satyajit-happy/themes
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-theme-aqua

---

Installation Instructions:

Extract the zip file to the themes directory i.e. "~/.themes/" or "/usr/share/themes/" or use Gnome Tweak Tool to install.

Install the User Theme Extension and use the Gnome Tweak tool to choose the themes.

To install the Gnome Shell theme without the User Theme Extension,

1. First backup your Gnome Shell theme directory i.e. "/usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/".

2. Extract the zip file and rename "gnome-shell" directory to "theme",

3. Copy it to "/usr/share/gnome-shell/".

4. Restart GNOME Shell by pressing "Alt+F2", then type r and press Enter.

Warning: This theme is not compatible with old Gnome Shell 3.0 (e.g.-Fedora 15). I'm not responsible if you try to use it on old Gnome Shell and things break.
